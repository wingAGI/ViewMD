## 🎯 The Hero Message

**Full-screen Markdown reading. No sidebar.**

**Read Markdown. Not edit it.**

This is what pure reading looks like. No distractions. No sidebars. Just you and your content, beautifully rendered across the entire screen.

## ⚖️ The Problem We Solve

### VS Code Preview is Too Small

**Left Side: VS Code / Online Editors**
- Tiny preview pane squeezed into a corner
- Sidebar taking up valuable screen space
- Editor tools you don't need when reading
- Cluttered interface distracting from content

**Right Side: View Markdown**
- Clean, full-screen reading experience
- Every pixel dedicated to your content
- Zero distractions, maximum focus
- Built for one thing: reading

**Most online tools are editors.**

**We're not. We're a reader.**

### What Makes It Different?

**It's not about features. It's about the experience.**

- **Code that shines**: Syntax highlighting that doesn't hurt your eyes
- **Tables that make sense**: Clear formatting for easy scanning
- **Images that fit**: Automatic optimization without losing quality

### How It Works

1. **Drag & Drop**: Drop your `.md` file onto the page
2. **Full Screen**: Automatically enters immersive reading mode
3. **Read**: Focus on content, nothing else

That's it. No settings. No configuration. No learning curve.
